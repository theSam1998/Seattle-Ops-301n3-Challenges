#Script: Seattle Ops 301n3 challenge 09
#Purpose: Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.
#!Equals: a == b
#!Not Equals: a != b
#!Less than: a < b
#!Less than or equal to: a <= b
#!Greater than: a > b
#!Greater than or equal to: a >= b
#!Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.
#!Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.
#Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
#Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.
#Create an if statement with two conditions by using and between conditions.
#Create an if statement with two conditions by using or between conditions.
#Create a nested if statement.
#Create an if statement that includes pass to avoid errors.

#Variables:
#sit, storing where the user is sitting as an argument when the function is called.
#chairs, storing the number of chairs the user has sat in as an integer in a variable.
