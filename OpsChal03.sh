#Script: Ops Challenge class 3
#Date of last revision: 04/28/2023
#Purpose: Create a script that allows for user input based permissions changes.
#Create a new bash script that performs the following:
#Prompts user for input directory path.
#Prompts user for input permissions number (e.g. 777 to perform a chmod 777)
#Navigates to directory input by user and changes all files inside it to input setting.
#Prints to screen directory contents and new permissions settings of everything in directory.
